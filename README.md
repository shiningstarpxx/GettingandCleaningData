+ README.md
+ code_book.md: to describes the variables, the data, and transformations
that performed to clean up the data
+ run_analysis.R: the script follows the instructions in the course
 1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
 2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation
for each measurement.
 3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
 4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
 5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set
with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
+ final_data.txt: a tidy data set that generated by the "run_analysis.R"
